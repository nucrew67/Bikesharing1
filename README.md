# Analysis 

    -Overview of the statistical analysis:
        This analysis's goal is to present a business plan that will persuade potential investors that creating a bike-sharing program in Des Moines can be a successful endeavor. Throughout the procedure, we produce visuals using publicly accessible data from the NYC CitiBike program archives and Tableau.

We use our data knowledge and critical thinking abilities to construct a story that can be presented to investors despite the fact that the data is based on activities that occurred in New York City, which is considerably different from Des Moines.

We settle on using data from August 2019 to construct our analysis for our presentation. In comparison to other seasons of the year, it is considered that the summer months have higher traffic or utilization.

We would need to examine more information, though, to make a compelling case for this suggestion by adding:



To calculate the distance traveled, create a visualization that depicts usage from the starting to the ending locations. Where
