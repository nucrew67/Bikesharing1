# Analysis 

    -Overview of the statistical analysis:
        This analysis's goal is to present a business plan that will persuade potential investors that creating a bike-sharing program in Des Moines can be a successful endeavor. Throughout the procedure, we produce visuals using publicly accessible data from the NYC CitiBike program archives and Tableau.

We use our data knowledge and critical thinking abilities to construct a story that can be presented to investors despite the fact that the data is based on activities that occurred in New York City, which is considerably different from Des Moines.

We settle on using data from August 2019 to construct our analysis for our presentation. In comparison to other seasons of the year, it is considered that the summer months have higher traffic or utilization.

## Results

### Total Rides, Customer Type and Gender Breakdown




### Checkout Times for Users

Almost all of the trips (99%) were under 60 minutes with 49% under 10 minutes (1.1M vs. 2.3M).


### Checkout Times by Gender

### legend 0=Female 1=Male 2=Unknown

Male riders are the primary user of the bike share program making up 65% of the population, with the remaining being 25% female and 10% unknown.


### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

![TripsWeekday](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nucrew67/Bikesharing1/main/images/TripsbyWeekdayHr.png)

Most of the rides during the weekdays (M-F) occur during commuting hours of 8-9a and 5-7pm. It can be assumed that the bike sharing program is the preferred method for commuting to and from work. 


### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

![TripGender](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nucrew67/Bikesharing1/main/images/TripsbyGenderWeekday.png)

### legend 0=Female 1=Male 2=Unknown

Male riders are more inclined to use the bike sharing program to commute to and from work, as well as during the weekend.


### Trips by Gender by Weekday

![TripWeekGender](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nucrew67/Bikesharing1/main/images/UserTripsGender.png)

### legend 0=Female 1=Male 2=Unknown

Thursday was the highest usage day among subscribers with the most usage occurring on Saturday for non-subscribers.


### Top Ending Location

Usage was more concentrated in Midtown and business areas which would suggest that bikes are primarily used for commuting.

## Summary

Based on the visualizations above for activities that occurred in New York City, we can summarize:

* Stalls located in heavily concentrated business areas, such as Midtown and Downtown made up the majority of the usage. 
* Subscribers are the primary user.
* The duration of most trips were under 10 minutes.

In summary, introducing a bike share program in Des Moines, IA may be a good business venture, as long as the program is installed in densely populated areas where mass transportation is highly used and parking is limited. However, we would need to review additional data in order to provide a strong case to support this recommendation by adding:

* Create visualization that maps out usage from starting to ending location to determine the distance traveled. Where are users starting their trip from and why? Are they using the bike to complete their commute after taking the bus or the train? 
* Add visualization to explore the activity by age group and adding demographic information to identify areas in which bikeshares would most likely be used (i.e. census data).
